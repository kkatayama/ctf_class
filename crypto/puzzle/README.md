# Puzzle
The flag was encrypted using AES-ECB and we got this hex: 96671e33b9559a6ea8070916be9f20b375605d6ccae058e568e25584beaa20c7b797aec388be78a9e4ccfb3ddd178b41. But we lost the plaintext flag and the key! Can you help us recover the flag?

We also encrypted a bunch of other flags using the same key.
