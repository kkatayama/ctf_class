CPEG 667 - udctf course

https://github.com/zelinsky/CTF-Course/tree/master

## Motivation
Having participated in number of online and locally hosted CTF competitions, my reference list of tools and personal repository of custom scripts have grown quite large.
I often find myself entering a new ctf competing as if starting from scratch, limiting myself to using tools I am most familiar with and writing, or rather re-writing scripts
similar to what I have written before.  I chose to take this course with the focus on increasing the number of tools to be familiar with, tackle reverse-engineering and stenography
challenges that I tend to not attempt in a typical ctf, and hopefully build script libraries that I can use in future ctf's with the hope of automating some of the tasks needed to 
solve challenges and capture flags.
